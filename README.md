Database Design

The database design outlines the key entities required for the project, including their important fields and relationships. These entities form the backbone of the application's data structure, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of information.

Key Entities and Fields





Users





user_id: Unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).



email: User's email address for login and communication.



name: User's full name for personalization.



password_hash: Securely hashed password for authentication.



role: User role (e.g., guest, host, admin) to manage permissions.



Properties





property_id: Unique identifier for each property (Primary Key).



host_id: Reference to the user who owns the property (Foreign Key to Users).



title: Name or title of the property (e.g., "Cozy Beach House").



location: Address or geographic coordinates of the property.



price_per_night: Cost of renting the property per night.



Bookings





booking_id: Unique identifier for each booking (Primary Key).



property_id: Reference to the booked property (Foreign Key to Properties).



user_id: Reference to the user making the booking (Foreign Key to Users).



check_in_date: Start date of the booking.



check_out_date: End date of the booking.



Reviews





review_id: Unique identifier for each review (Primary Key).



property_id: Reference to the reviewed property (Foreign Key to Properties).



user_id: Reference to the user who wrote the review (Foreign Key to Users).



rating: Numerical rating (e.g., 1-5 stars).



comment: Textual feedback about the property.



Payments





payment_id: Unique identifier for each payment (Primary Key).



booking_id: Reference to the associated booking (Foreign Key to Bookings).



user_id: Reference to the user making the payment (Foreign Key to Users).



amount: Total payment amount.



payment_status: Status of the payment (e.g., pending, completed, failed).

Entity Relationships





Users to Properties: A user (host) can own multiple properties, but each property is associated with only one user (host). This is a one-to-many relationship.



Properties to Bookings: A property can have multiple bookings, but each booking is linked to only one property. This is a one-to-many relationship.



Users to Bookings: A user (guest) can make multiple bookings, but each booking is associated with one user. This is a one-to-many relationship.



Bookings to Reviews: A booking can have one review (optional), and each review is tied to one booking and one property. This is a one-to-one relationship between bookings and reviews, and a many-to-one relationship from reviews to properties.



Bookings to Payments: A booking can have one payment, and each payment is tied to one booking. This is a one-to-one relationship.

Feature Breakdown

The following features form the core functionality of the project, enabling users to interact with the platform seamlessly. Each feature contributes to a cohesive user experience for managing properties, bookings, and payments.





User Management





Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Supports role-based access for guests, hosts, and admins, ensuring secure and personalized interactions.



Property Management





Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with details like location, price, and amenities. This feature drives the platform's core offering by allowing hosts to showcase their properties.



Booking System





Facilitates users booking properties for specific dates, checking availability, and confirming reservations. It ensures a smooth and reliable process for securing accommodations.



Review System





Allows guests to leave ratings and comments for properties theyâ€™ve stayed at, building trust and transparency. This feature helps users make informed decisions based on community feedback.



Payment Processing





Handles secure payment transactions for bookings, supporting multiple payment methods. It ensures financial reliability and trust between users and the platform.

CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery. For this project, a CI/CD pipeline is critical to maintain code quality, catch bugs early, and streamline updates to the production environment.

Tools for CI/CD





GitHub Actions: A platform for automating workflows, enabling continuous integration through automated testing and deployment to staging or production environments.



Docker: Used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.



Jenkins: An alternative CI/CD tool for orchestrating complex pipelines, integrating with version control and deployment systems.



Kubernetes: For managing containerized deployments, ensuring scalability and reliability in production.
